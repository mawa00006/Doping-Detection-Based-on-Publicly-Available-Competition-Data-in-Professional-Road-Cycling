How to scrape data from procyclingstats.com using this script.


Use the included environment.yml file to duplicate the env that was used to run this script
on your machine.

To able to run the script on a unix machine you need to include the requests_html.py file
which allows 'headless' browser access. Using this file creates a warning that can be ignored.
When using a Windows/Mac machine you can delete the file and use the vanilla requests_html library.

To export the dataframes change the paths inlines 103-105 in main.py.
